# Adventure Game

> This took more time than expected, but the outcome is something I am genuinely proud of.

A lightweight terminal-based RPG adventure game built in Python.
You wake up inside ancient ruins with nothing but a little health, a limited supply of water, and a path full of life-or-death choices. Every decision shapes the journey ahead—some choices lead toward freedom, others toward danger, and a few toward unexpected endings.

- The goal is simple: Survive the ruins and escape alive.
- The path to freedom, however, is anything but simple.
