# Rock, Paper, Scissor game

> A branching narrative text game implemented using nested conditional statements (if/elif/else).

### Requirements :  
- The narrative must begin with a clear scenario and at least two distinct paths (e.g., "left" or "right").
- Each path must lead to further choices, creating a minimum of 8 unique final outcomes (endings).
- All user inputs must be processed to handle variations in spelling and capitalization.
- State Tracking: Introduce a simple "Inventory" or "Health" variable (e.g., gold = 0, health = 100) that is affected by choices and can lead to specific, locked endings (e.g., "You didn't have enough gold, game over.").
