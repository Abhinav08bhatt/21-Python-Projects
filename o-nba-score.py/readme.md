# NBA Stats & Score Tracker

A Python script that pulls live NBA data from the official NBA API endpoints and displays team scoring leaders and game scoreboard information.

## Requirements :

- The script must request NBA data using the requests module.
- The script must fetch API endpoint links dynamically from today.json.
- The program must be able to display:
    - Current NBA scoreboard (teams, scores, game clock, period)
    - Team points-per-game (PPG) rankings   
    - Team stats must be filtered, sorted by ranking, and printed in order.
    - Output must be printed directly in the terminal.

# Note :
The NBA API breaks a lot and may randomly stop working depending on endpoint changes or availability.
