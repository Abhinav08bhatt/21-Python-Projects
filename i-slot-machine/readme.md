# Slot Machine 🎰

A simple command-line slot machine game where the player bets their money and watches the slots spin. Each round either multiplies the balance or divides it based on luck.

## Features

- User deposits an initial balance.
- Randomly generated 3-slot spin using numbers 1–3.
- Matching all 3 slots multiplies your balance (1x, 2x, or 3x).
- Non-matching slots divide your balance by the highest rolled number.
- User can continue playing or quit anytime.
- Automatic termination when balance becomes too low to continue.
- Clean console UI and smooth text animation.

## How It Works

1. Enter your starting amount.
2. Choose whether to bet or quit each round.
3. The slot machine spins and updates your balance.
4. Continue until you quit or run out of money.

Enjoy the game, and may luck be on your side!
